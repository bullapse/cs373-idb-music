    "Comments": "We noticed a problem that we think is related to caching. Sometimes when we run the app at notspotify.me, the old css file gets lodaded. When running locally or on notspotify-162300.appspot.com we never have the issue. The last member in our group decided to drop the class, so we're only a group of 4."
