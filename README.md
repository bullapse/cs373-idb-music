## Introduction

Music has always been one of the most widely consumed sources of entertainment. The average consumer’s access to music has grown exponentially since the emergence of streaming services like Spotify and Apple Music. With these streaming services, customers have access to millions of artists, albums and songs. There is a huge amount of data associated with all of this music, and the ability to easily recognize and analyze this data could help to solve a wide range of problems for consumers and businesses. A listener should have the ability to quickly and intuitively search for information on artists, albums, and songs of their choice without having to navigate all of the features of their streaming service. Businesses should be able to easily gather information on the complex state of music, so that they can meet the needs of their customers.

Our application seeks to address these problems and open up a world of easily accessible information on music to listeners, businesses and musicians. With Notspotify™ a listener can learn everything they need to know about an artist they recently discovered, including the albums they’ve recorded, the genre they belong to, and many other things. Music-industry businesses can use Notspotify to find out what artists are on the rise, based on our artists popularity data. They can even listen to previews of these artists’ music, allowing them to make quick judgments and discover new artists rapidly. Musicians who are looking to grow their fanbase can use Notspotify to stay updated how many followers they have, and how many listens their songs are getting.

Notspotify makes the crazy world of music data easily available to whoever wants to access it. Learning more about music should be easy, so we implemented the best technologies available to solve this problem. The rest of this report will detail the technologies and strategies we used to make this possible.
